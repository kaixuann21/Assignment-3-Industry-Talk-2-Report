## Reflection
On 18th December 2025, I participated in an online industry talk about “Project Management and System Development” 
by speaker Ts.Hj.Abdul Alim bin Abdul Muttalib. He is the head of Technology and Innovation at Serunai Commerce Sdn 
Bhd and obtained enriching industry experiences.

In this talk, I gained useful insights about system development and project management from an industry perspective. 
The talk also explained about how technology and innovation are crucial for aligning with real business rather than technical
performance. The speaker also shared the importance of adaptability, teamwork and never stopping learning in managing projects,
especially in an environment that changes rapidly. 

This talk helped me build a solid foundation in my computer science journey. Furthermore, I also gained a clearer understanding 
of how the lessons learnt in class will transform into real-world systems and projects. After this talk, I decided to improve my 
technical skills and communication skills, which are extremely important in the technology and information systems field.

Thank you to the speaker and Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd as well as the organizers for having this amazing industry talk. 
I hope I can attend more meaningful industry talks in the future.
